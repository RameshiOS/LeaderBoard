🎮 Swift Leaderboard App

An advanced Leaderboard System built in Swift, demonstrating the power of Hashable, Equatable, Comparable, and Identifiable protocols. 🚀

📌 Features

🏆 Sort Players by score using Comparable

🔍 Fast Lookups in dictionaries using Hashable

✅ Check Equality of players using Equatable

🔗 SwiftUI Integration with Identifiable

🛠️ Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leaderboard-app.git

Open the project in Xcode.

Run the app on a simulator or device.

🚀 How It Works

Player Model Implementation

struct Player: Equatable, Hashable, Comparable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let score: Int
    
    static func == (lhs: Player, rhs: Player) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.score == rhs.score
    }
    
    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(name)
        hasher.combine(score)
    }
    
    static func < (lhs: Player, rhs: Player) -> Bool {
        return lhs.score > rhs.score // Higher score ranks first
    }
}

Sorting the Leaderboard

var players: [Player] = [
    Player(id: UUID(), name: "Alice", score: 1500),
    Player(id: UUID(), name: "Bob", score: 1200),
    Player(id: UUID(), name: "Charlie", score: 1800)
]

let sortedPlayers = players.sorted()
